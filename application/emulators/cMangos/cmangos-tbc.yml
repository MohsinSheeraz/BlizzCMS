# Description: This configuration file is tailored for cMangos-TBC,
#              a World of Warcraft emulator for The Burning Crusade expansion.
#              It specifies the hashing algorithm used for passwords,
#              column mappings for different database tables, and example SQL queries.
# ============================================

# Emulator Configuration
config:
  # Specifies the type of hashing algorithm to use for generating password hashes.
  # Available options include:
  # - 'hex': Applies a hexadecimal-based algorithm for hashing (used in cMangos).
  # - 'srp6': Utilizes the SRP-6a algorithm with modular arithmetic (not typically used in cMangos).
  # - 'bnet': Uses SHA-256 with additional steps such as string reversal (used in some older emulators).
  # - null or any other unspecified value: Defaults to using SHA-1 for hashing, which is less secure.
  #
  # For cMangos-TBC, 'hex' is typically used.
  type: "srp6"
  expansion: 2  # The expansion is set to 2 for The Burning Crusade.
