# Configuration Emulator
config:
    # Specifies the type of hashing algorithm used for generating password hashes.
    # The choice of hashing type depends on the specific emulator and version being used:
    # - 'bnet': Uses SHA-256 hashing with additional string reversal steps (very old TrinityCore versions).
    # - 'hex': Applies a hexadecimal-based hashing algorithm (used in cmangos).
    # - 'srp6': Utilizes the SRP-6a hashing algorithm with modular arithmetic (used in AzerothCore and older TrinityCore versions).
    # - 'srpV1': Implements the SRP-V1 hashing algorithm, combining hashing and modular arithmetic (used in newer TrinityCore versions).
    # - 'srpV2': Applies the SRP-V2 hashing algorithm, which includes more advanced hashing and modular arithmetic (used in the latest TrinityCore versions).
    # - null or any other unspecified value: Defaults to using SHA-1 for hashing, which may be less secure.
    # 
    # Select the hashing type according to your application's security requirements and compatibility needs.
