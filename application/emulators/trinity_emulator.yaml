# Description: This configuration file is tailored for Trinity,
#              a World of Warcraft emulator. It specifies the
#              hashing algorithm used for passwords, column mappings
#              for different database tables, and example SQL queries.
# ============================================
config:
  # Specifies the type of hashing algorithm to use for generating password hashes.
  # Available options include:
  # - 'bnet': Uses SHA-256 with additional steps such as string reversal (old TrinityCore versions).
  # - 'hex': Applies a hexadecimal-based algorithm for hashing (used in cmangos).
  # - 'srp6': Utilizes the SRP-6a algorithm with modular arithmetic (AzerothCore and old TrinityCore versions).
  # - 'srpV1': Implements the SRP-V1 algorithm, combining hashing and modular arithmetic (new TrinityCore versions).
  # - 'srpV2': Applies the SRP-V2 algorithm, with more advanced hashing and modular arithmetic steps (latest TrinityCore versions).
  # - null or any other unspecified value: Defaults to using SHA-1 for hashing, which may be less secure.
  #
  # Choose the hashing type based on the security requirements and compatibility needs of your application.
